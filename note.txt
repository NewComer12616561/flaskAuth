Loggin in as admin wouldn't auto redirect to admin page
Loggin in as teacher wouldn't auto redirect to admin page(what would first page be like ?) 
teacher dashboard with some link to redirect to create new class, allow student into class ? 

Enroll in not working as intended ->  clicking on said button in teacher page(same with student) would redirect to dashboard
Whenever teacher done create class, would redirect to dashboard instead of classes route
classes page route from teacher would show enroll button for each class created by teacher->
should replace enroll button with view and inside said page would have list of all student enroll ?
