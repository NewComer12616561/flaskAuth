Whenever teacher done create class, would redirect to dashboard instead of classes route -fix
classes page route from teacher would show enroll button for each class created by teacher->
should replace enroll button with view and inside said page would have list of all student enroll ? -done

what's done :create dashboard for student, teacher
add UI for teacher, student
add UI for admin dashboard
add basic attendance to teacher and student
student can take picture of their face

Asked: how to implement attendance system into this mess: push api from website -> face recognition then from fr -> website for attendance
ToDo: face attendance
suggest:
add picture for user model 
only teacher can check attendance

Try seperate route, model from app.py
